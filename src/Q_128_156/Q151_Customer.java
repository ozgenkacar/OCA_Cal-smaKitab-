/*
Any amount of electricity used by a customer (represented by an instance of the Customer class) must
contribute to the customer's bill (represented by the member variable bill) through the useElectricity method.
An instance of the Customer class should never be able to tamper with or decrease the value of the member
variable bill.
How should you write methods in the ElectricAccount class at line n1 so that the member variable bill
is always equal to the value of the member variable kwh multiplied by the member variable rate?
